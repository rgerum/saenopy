SAENOPY is a free open source 3D traction force microscopy software. Its material model is especially well suited for
tissue-mimicking and typically highly non-linear biopolymer matrices such as collagen, fibrin, or Matrigel. 

It features a python package to use in scripts and an extensive graphical user interface.

Check out our [Documentation](https://saenopy.readthedocs.io) on how to install and use it.

## Installation

### Standalone
To use saenopy without a complicated installation you can use our standalone binaries to get started right away on Windows or Linux.

Windows
https://github.com/rgerum/saenopy/releases/download/v1.0.2/saenopy.exe

Linux
https://github.com/rgerum/saenopy/releases/download/v1.0.2/saenopy

### Using Python

If you are experienced with python or even want to use our Python API, you need to install saenopy as a python package.
Saenopy can be installed directly using pip:

    ``pip install saenopy``

Now you can start the user interface with:

    ``saenopy``

## Getting started
To get started you can have a look at our collection of [example datasets](https://saenopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html).

## Preprint
