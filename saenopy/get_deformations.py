    Replace invalid vectors in a velocity field using an iterative image inpainting algorithm.

    The algorithm is the following:

    1) For each element in the arrays of the ``u`` and ``v`` components, replace it by a weighted average
       of the neighbouring elements which are not invalid themselves. The weights depend
       on the method type. If ``method=localmean`` weight are equal to 1/( (2*kernel_size+1)**2 -1 )

    2) Several iterations are needed if there are adjacent invalid elements.
       If this is the case, inforation is "spread" from the edges of the missing
       regions iteratively, until the variation is below a certain threshold.

    Parameters

    u : 2d or 3d np.ndarray

    kernel_size : int

    Replace NaN elements in an array using an iterative image inpainting algorithm.
      The algorithm is the following:
      1) For each element in the input array, replace it by a weighted average
         of the neighbouring elements which are not NaN themselves. The weights
         depend on the method type. See Methods below.
      2) Several iterations are needed if there are adjacent NaN elements.
         If this is the case, information is "spread" from the edges of the missing
         regions iteratively, until the variation is below a certain threshold.
      Methods:
      localmean - A square kernel where all elements have the same value,
                  weights are equal to n/( (2*kernel_size+1)**2 -1 ),
                  where n is the number of non-NaN elements.
      disk - A circular kernel where all elements have the same value,
             kernel is calculated by::
                 if ((S-i)**2 + (S-j)**2)**0.5 <= S:
                     kernel[i,j] = 1.0
                 else:
                     kernel[i,j] = 0.0
             where S is the kernel radius.
      distance - A circular inverse distance kernel where elements are
                 weighted proportional to their distance away from the
                 center of the kernel, elements farther away have less
                 weight. Elements outside the specified radius are set
                 to 0.0 as in 'disk', the remaining of the weights are
                 calculated as::
                     maxDist = ((S)**2 + (S)**2)**0.5
                     kernel[i,j] = -1*(((S-i)**2 + (S-j)**2)**0.5 - maxDist)
                 where S is the kernel radius.
      Parameters
      ----------
      array : 2d or 3d np.ndarray
          an array containing NaN elements that have to be replaced
      max_iter : int
          the number of iterations
      tol : float
          On each iteration check if the mean square difference between
          values of replaced elements is below a certain tolerance `tol`
      kernel_size : int
          the size of the kernel, default is 1
      method : str
          the method used to replace invalid values. Valid options are
          `localmean`, `disk`, and `distance`.
      Returns
      -------
