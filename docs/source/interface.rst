Interface
=========

.. figure:: images/Interface_main.png

The main interface offers saenopys three subprograms:

    - The TFM Solver that calculates displacements and forces from 3D image stacks
    - The simplified solver that uses 2D images and assumes they have a symmetric 3D field
    - The fiber orientation detector analyses the orientation of fibers in a 2D image as a proxy for contraction force
